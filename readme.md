## Wheel Stands

Stands/mounts for your wheel and pedals, recommended for even the most basic of setups. Great for portability and storage, as they're able to fold when needed and are relatively light, so you could set one up in front of the living room sofa when you're playing and put it away when you're done.

## Cockpits

For the most comfortable and immersive experience, it’s best to pair the wheel and pedals mounts with a racing seat, with it all bolted together for the best stability. If you want to use sound transducers, then a proper cockpit is definitely recommended.

## Motion Cockpits / Platforms

Wondering when the super-expensive options were gonna come? Yeah, here they are. With these, the seat is designed to move based on forces acting on the in-game car, allowing greater immersion by feeling sensations an actual driver would. It's almost like it has FFB for your bum, except the seat simulates the car's movements, not just the wheels' motions. That may sound great and all, especially for VR racing… but keep in mind that the cheapest options are usually about $3,000, and many are priced at, or exceed $30,000.

[Canis Motion GT1 MP]() - Turns out you don’t need to be on PC to have a motion cockpit; Canis very much want you to know that this is compatible with the 8th generation consoles (and PS3).

Full motion, tilt and turn
Distance adjustable multi-bar wheel support (goes around legs)
Pre-drilled for wheel hard-mounting and pedal hard-mounting, wheel and pedals included (G29, G920, or Thrustmaster T300)
32 or 42 inch 1080p screen and mount optional
Bucket seat optional, weight capacity unknown
Shifter mount included
5.1 surround sound system included
Console compatible

[CXC Motion Pro II]() - The starting cost is more expensive than a Nissan 370Z Nismo. With all of the extra options, the price becomes more expensive than a Mercedes CLS Coupe. Renting it for a large event? Maybe. Buying it for personal use? Only if "affordable" means nothing to you.

Full motion, tilt and turn
Height adjustable multi-bar wheel support (goes around legs)
Built-in wheel and pedals included
One or three 55 inch TVs and mounts included
Bucket seat included, unknown weight capacity
No shifter mount

Pre-drilled for wheel hard-mounting
Compatible with screen mount
Seat not included
Shifter mount not included
Speaker mounts not included
PC

[Fast Track Sims TC-R1 Turn Key D-box]() - I can’t tell if Fast Track Sims decided to just utilize the cockpit they had in multiple different forms and just named them as such, or if they ran out of ideas for names.

Full motion, tilt and turn
Static multi-bar wheel support (goes around legs)
Pre-drilled for wheel hard-mounting and pedal hard-mounting, Leo Bodnar Sim Steering wheel and Fast Track pedals included
Three 40 inch 1080p screens and mounting included
Bucket seat included, unknown weight capacity
Shifter mount and TSW Shifter included
5.1 surround sound system included

Pre-drilled for wheel hard-mounting and pedal hard-mounting
Compatible with screen mount
Reclining seat included, 130 kg / 285 lbs weight capacity
Shifter mount included
No speaker mounts
PC (included)

[Playseat Motion]() - The lowest priced option here at about $1,600. Not surprising, considering that this isn’t a full cockpit, it is the motion platform that you put a Playseat cockpit on top of.

Full motion, tilt and turn
Wheel support dependent on cockpit added
Mounting dependent on cockpit added
Screen mount dependent on cockpit added
Weight capacity unknown
Shifter mount dependent on cockpit added
Speaker mounts dependent on cockpit added

[SimCraft APEX3 GT]() - The FAQ says it’s currently PC-only (though they say they’re working on console compatibility), yet it has been shown to work with Gran Turismo 6 (a PS3-only game), and on the site’s list of compatible titles, it has Gran Turismo (6) listed. So… it might be PS3 compatible?
